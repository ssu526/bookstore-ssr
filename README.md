A simple bookstore app developed using React, Express.js, and server-side rendering.

Demo - https://bookstore-blazesoft.onrender.com/books.

### Local development

- In src/components/Home.js, change API_BASE_URL to localhost:8000
- `npm run build-and-run` to build the app and start the server
- Go to http://localhost:8000/books
- If app is built already, `npm start` to start the server without rebuilding the app
